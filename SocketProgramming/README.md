# Simple Server-Client Chat Application

This is a simple implementation of a server-client chat application in Java using sockets.

## Features

- Allows communication between a server and a client over a network.
- The server sends a welcome message to client upon connection.
- Client can send messages to the server.

## Usage

1. **Server**: Run the `Server.java` file to start the server. The server will listen for client connections on port 1234.

2. **Client**: Run the `Client.java` file to start a client. The client will connect to the server running on localhost at port 1234.

3. Once connected, clients can send messages to the server by typing them into the console. The server will echo the messages back to the clients.
