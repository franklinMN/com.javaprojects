# IMPLEMENTING ADVANCED ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM

## Step 1: Understand Symmetric Encryption Basics
AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm, meaning the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. Before diving into AES, it's essential to understand the basics of symmetric encryption, including how keys are generated, managed, and used to encrypt and decrypt data.

## Step 2: Learn the Basics of Block Ciphers
AES is a block cipher, which means it encrypts data in fixed-size blocks. In the case of AES, each block is 128 bits (16 bytes) in size. Understanding how block ciphers work and how they process data is crucial to understanding AES.

## Step 3: Understand AES Key Sizes and Rounds
AES supports three key sizes: 128 bits, 192 bits, and 256 bits. The number of rounds in AES depends on the key size: 10 rounds for 128-bit keys, 12 rounds for 192-bit keys, and 14 rounds for 256-bit keys. Each round of AES consists of several transformations applied to the input data.

## Step 4: Learn AES Transformations
AES operates on a two-dimensional array of bytes called the "state." During encryption and decryption, this state undergoes several transformations in each round:

- SubBytes: Each byte of the state is substituted with another byte using a substitution table (S-box).
- ShiftRows: The bytes in each row of the state are shifted cyclically to the left.
- MixColumns: Each column of the state is multiplied with a fixed polynomial in the Galois field.
- AddRoundKey: Each byte of the state is combined with a round key using bitwise XOR.

## Step 5: Implement Key Expansion
Before encryption or decryption can begin, the initial key must be expanded into a set of round keys. This process involves generating additional round keys from the original key using a key schedule algorithm.

## Step 6: Implement Encryption and Decryption
Once the key expansion is complete, you can proceed with the encryption and decryption processes. These processes involve applying the specified number of rounds (based on the key size) of transformations to the input data using the generated round keys.
