# Factory Pattern

The Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It is useful when the creation of an object involves complex logic or when the exact type of the object may not be known until runtime.

## Here's how the Factory Pattern works:

- **Factory Interface:** Define an interface or an abstract class that declares a method for creating objects. This method typically returns an object of a specific type.

- **Concrete Factories:** Create concrete implementations of the factory interface. Each concrete factory is responsible for creating objects of a specific type or family of related types.

- **Client Code:** In client code, use the factory interface to create objects without knowing their concrete classes. Clients only interact with the factory interface, not with the concrete factories directly.

- **Runtime Configuration:** The choice of which concrete factory to use can be determined dynamically at runtime, based on configuration, user input, or other factors.
